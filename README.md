# CS-300

# _What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?_
# Throughout the duration of this course, we were presented with a number of projects requiring the implementation of data structures such as vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. The implementation of these data structures enabled sorting of a given data set. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
# 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
